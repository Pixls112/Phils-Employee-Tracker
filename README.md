 ## Description
 For week 12, my project was to create an application using the inquirer package and mySQL2. The goal was to create an application that would load in a database containing information about the different departments, roles, and employees of a company. In the application we should be able to view the departments, roles, and employees when the user answers the given prompt. The application is also capable of adding new departments, roles, and employees to the data base while also allowing the user to update existing data tables as well.

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself.

 ## Usage
 The main usage of this project is to show off the capabilities of sql and how to initialize it. Soon I will be able to implement sql with things such as html to allow the database to be able to populate a html page for the front end.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I used the student mini project for week 12 to help give me a sense of direction on where to start<br />
 I also used w3 to help me with the SQL when I didn't know the proper query. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp

 ## Testing
 To test my application simply launch it your prefered coding program in my case visualstudio, you first want to install inquirer and mysql2 package, then you want to source the sql files by simply right-clicking the sql file, clicking terminal, use commands "mysql -u root -p" and simply write "SOURCE "file name"". Once the database has been sourced, simply go to the server.js file fill in your sql password and in the terminal type "npm start". YOu can then begin to mess around by clicking the various prompts.
